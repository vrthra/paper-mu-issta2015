Action Plan:

We need to improve the papers in the following ways:

1- Writing:
	# Methodology:
	  - Section 3.2. FSE reviewer 1 had some concerns about it.
	  - Why R^2 is a proper metric for this analysis?
	  - R^2 vs R? (Reviewer 3 concerns)
	  - Kendall \Tau_b

	# Results:
		- Elaborate and Hightligth the results
		- Checking the novelty/usefulness of sampling techniques that we 
			applied. Remove the ones that seems not usefull or interesting.
		- Better Visualization. Maybe in a URL we can provide some visulaizetion.

2- Experimentation:
	# Adding some of common projects that has been used in other studies, e.g. JodaTime.
		Note: JodaTime in Laura's experiments was an outlier.
	# Trying hybrid approaches. E.g., Sampling from selective mutants or selctive from 
		sampled mutants.
