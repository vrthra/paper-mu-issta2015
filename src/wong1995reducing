A number of studies in the past have looked at the relative merits of operator
selection and random sampling criteria, starting with Wong and Mathur in
1995~\cite{wong1995reducing}.  They observed that x\% selection up to 10\%
and constrained mutation had similar accuracy, and that constrained mutation
provided similar reduction (80\%) compared to sampling. It is to be noted
that the x\% selection was applied on top of each operator, and not directly
on the whole set of mutants.
