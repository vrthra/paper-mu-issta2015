Offutt showed empirical support for one of the basic premises of mutation testing, that a test data set that detects simple faults (such as those introduced by mutation) will detect complex faults, i.e., the combination of several simple faults.

X. Cai and M. R. Lyu. The effect of code coverage on fault detection under different testing profiles. In International Workshop on Advances in Model-Based Testing, pages 1–7, 2005
 investigated the correlation between different coverage criteria—branch coverage, decision cover- age, P-use, and C-use—and fault detection, using a linear regression model
 Their results showed that coverage criteria were only a moderate indicator for fault detection, with large variance for different test suites.

  abstract = "Of the various testing strategies, mutation testing has been empirically found to be effective in detecting faults. However, mutation often imposes unacceptable demands on computing    and human resources because of the large number of mutants that need to be compiled and executed on one or more test cases. In addition, the tester needs to examine many mutants and analyze these  for possible equivalence with the program under test. For these reasons, mutation is generally regarded as too expensive to use. Because one significant component of the cost of mutation is the    execution of mutants against test cases, we believe that this cost can be reduced dramatically by reducing the number of mutants that need to be examined. We report results from a case study       designed to investigate two alternatives for reducing the cost of mutation. The alternatives considered are randomly selected x% mutation and constrained abs/ror mutation. We provide experimental  data indicating that both alternatives lead to test sets that distinguish a significant number of nonequivalent mutants and provide high all-uses coverage. "
